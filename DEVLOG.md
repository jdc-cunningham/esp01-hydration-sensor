Here we go again... just got the Seeeduino, soldered the male headers on and powered it on through the 5V. Looks like it is preloaded with some blink sketch.

Ehh.. I'm burnt today I have to program the ESP-01 then program Seeeduino then wire them up. Using this [page](https://www.instructables.com/Serial-Communication-Between-Arduino-and-ESP-01/) for the serial wiring.
